This is a simple PassGAN demonstration, utilizing Generating Adversarial Network GANs to generate unique passwords
#this project :
PASS-GAN (Password Generating Adversarial Network) is an educational project aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in generating secure and diverse passwords. PASS-GAN utilizes the power of GANs to produce unique passwords suitable for various applications. Please note that this project is a simple demo, and intended for educational purposes only and has not undergone formal evaluation. The effectiveness of the generated passwords is assessed through personal evaluation rather than through rigorous testing methodologies. 
#Steps :
1- Data Collection Gather a dataset of passwords
2- Data Preprocessing
3- define GAN Architecture
4- train the GAN
5- craft new passwords
